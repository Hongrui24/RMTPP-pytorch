### Preparation and How to Run the Code
You can run the code on your own computer or on python notebooks like Google Colab, Anaconda Jupyter Notebook. It is recommended to run the script on google colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) or similar python notebooks if you do not have a dedicated GPU on your computer. 

To run the program on your computer, please make sure that you have the following files and packages downloaded.<br />
- Python3: you can download through the link here: (https://www.python.org/) </pre>
- Numpy: you can dowload it through command <pre>pip install numpy</pre>
- Scikit-Learn: you can download it through command <pre>pip install sklearn</pre>
- Scipy: you can download it through command <pre>pip install scipy</pre>
- Pytorch: pytorch installation is more complicated than the package described above. You can go to (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for more information. If you still cannot install it on windows computer through pip, you can download Anaconda first and then download the pytorch through method described here: (https://dziganto.github.io/data%20science/python/anaconda/Creating-Conda-Environments/)
